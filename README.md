# Patient Data Visualization App

## Overview
This application uses a Python backend with Flask to serve FHIR-compliant patient data through an API. It also serves as a website that visualizes the patients' basic demographic data using D3.js. The data used in this project was generated by [Synthea](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea).

The data was then filtered to only include basic patient demographics data and not diving into their full medical history. As an example use-case, visualization of the patients' age groups and genders are shown in a diverging stacked-bar chart, which highlights the exact number of patients in each group/of which gender in a tooltip when hovering over the bars - with the ability to manipulate the chart by adding simple patient records into the dataset.
